In many scenarios, different wireless technologies coexist in the shared frequency medium as well as the physical space. Such wireless coexistence may lead to serious cross-technology interference (CTI) problems, e.g., channel competition, signal collision, and throughput degradation. Compared with traditional methods like interference avoidance, tolerance, and concurrency mechanism, direct and timely information exchange among heterogeneous devices is therefore a fundamental requirement to ensure the usability, inter-operability, and reliability of the IoT. Under this circumstance, Cross-Technology Communication (CTC) technique thus becomes a hot topic in both academic and industrial fields, which aims at directly exchanging data among heterogeneous devices that follow different standards. This paper comprehensively summarizes the CTC techniques and reveals that the key challenge for CTC lies in the heterogeneity of IoT devices, including the incompatibility of technical standards and the asymmetry of connection capability. Based on the above finding, we present a taxonomy of the existing CTC works (packet-level CTCs and physical-level CTCs) and compare the existing CTC techniques in terms of throughput, reliability, hardware modification, and concurrency.},\n    journal = {ACM Comput.

Despite the body of literature proposing several scheduling schemes for TSCH, a gap yet to be filled is the design of an effective way to deal with internal and external interference, which are both known to strongly affect communication performance. In fact, existing works either make use of a fixed schedule (and hence cannot cope with interference), or re-quire extra control traffic (and hence increase energy consumption). In this paper, we present SmarTiSCH, an interference-aware en-gine for IEEE 802.15.4e-based networks that retains the simplicity and energy-efficiency of autonomous scheduling, while increasing the awareness as well as robustness to both internal and external interference. With SmarTiSCH, the nodes in the network infer the presence of interference and react to it without the need of extra control traffic. Specifically, SmarTiSCH enables each node to infer the interference by passively observing existing data exchanges. It then lets a pair of nodes exchange information and mutually agree on a proper strategy to mitigate interference without the need of extra transmissions. We implement SmarTiSCH in Contiki-NG and evaluate its performance on a testbed of 20 off-the-shelf IEEE 802.15.4 devices based on the nRF52840. Our results show that SmarTiSCH increases the reliability of transmissions by up to 2.9 times compared to state-of-the-art approaches in the presence of interference, while even lowering the duty cycle by 54.3%.},\n    keywords={},\n    url={https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9825921},\n    doi={10.1109/IPSN54338.2022.00035},\n    ISSN={},\n    month={May}\n}",

The state of the art on CTC employs physical-level emulation. Due to the protocol incompatibility and the hardware restriction, there are intrinsic emulation errors between the emulated signals and the legitimate signals. Unresolved emulation errors hurt the reliability of CTC and the achievable throughput, but how to improve the reliability of CTC remains a challenging problem. Taking the CTC from WiFi to BLE as an example, this work first presents a comprehensive understanding of the emulation errors. We then propose WEB, a practical CTC approach that can be implemented with commercial devices. The core design of WEB is split encoding: based on the probabilistic distribution of emulation errors, the WiFi sender manipulates its payload to maximize the successful decoding rate at the BLE receiver. We implement WEB and evaluate its performance with extensive experiments. Compared to two existing approaches, WEBee and WIDE, WEB reduces the SER (Symbol Error Rate) by 54.6% and 42.2%, respectively. For the first time in the community, WEB achieves practically effective CTC from WiFi to BLE, with an average throughput of 522.2 Kbps.},\n    journal = {ACM Trans. Sen. Netw.

By receiving its BLE advertisements, nearby devices can estimate the proximity to the iBeacon or calculate indoor positions. However, the open nature of these advertisements brings vulnerability to impersonation attacks. Such attacks could lead to spam, unreliable positioning, and even security breaches. In this paper, we propose Wi-attack, revealing the feasibility of using WiFi devices to conduct impersonation attacks on iBeacon services. Different from impersonation attacks using BLE compatible hardware, Wi-attack is not restricted by broadcasting intervals and is able to impersonate multiple iBeacons at the same time. Effective attacks can be launched on iBeacon services without modifications to WiFi hardware or firmware. To enable direct communication from WiFi to BLE, we use the digital emulation technique of cross technology communication. To enhance the packet reception along with its stability, we add redundant packets to eliminate cyclic prefix error entirely. The emulation provides an iBeacon packet reception rate up to 66.2%. We conduct attacks on three iBeacon services scenarios, point deployment, multilateration, and fingerprint-based localization. The evaluation results show that Wi-attack can bring an average distance error of more than 20 meters on fingerprint-based localization using only 3 APs.},\n    keywords={},\n    url={https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9491605},\n    doi={10.1109/SECON52354.2021.9491605},\n    ISSN={2155-5494},\n    month={July},\n}",
